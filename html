with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have
"Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian
Park" for its rainforest protected area.

most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into
